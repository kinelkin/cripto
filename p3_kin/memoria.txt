Given a base b, an exponent e and modulo m, compute be (mod m):

Create an integer (or long) variable called result and set this result equal to 1.
Check the least significant bit (2⁰) of the exponent e. If it is 1, set result equal to base.
Check each bit in the exponent by iteratively bitshifting and masking against 1 - this checks each position in order, starting from the second-least-significant bit (we have already considered the least significant bit in stage 2.
Start a loop
At each iteration, set base equal to the value of the previous base squared, modulo m
At each stage, if the LSB of e is set, set result equal to the product of the previous result and the current base (which is the previous base squared, as described in stage 3), all modulo m
When the value of e is NULL, end the loop
The value of result is the product of all b to the power of two for all powers of two that constitute the exponent.
In summary, set the result to be 1. Starting from the least significant bit of the exponent, iteratively check each bit - which denotes that the particular power of two is a component of the exponent. Square the base modulo m at each stage. If the exponent bit is set, multiply the base with the current result, modulo m. The final result is the base raised to the exponent mod m - the product of a set of base raised to exponents that constitute the original exponent broken into powers of two.
